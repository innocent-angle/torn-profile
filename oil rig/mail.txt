<p>Hi there, sorry to bother you. I noticed you don't have a job and was wondering if you might want one.</p>
<p>I recently started an oil rig and I'm offering good pay on top of lucrative job perks and rotating trains.</p>
<p><b>Currently looking for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>100,000 in any stat (might consider slightly less)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2-4m pay based on stats and EE merits</li>
<li>Lucrative perks add even more income</li>
<li>Trains will always be free on rotation</li>
</ul>
<p><b><b>General requirements are to log in daily and rehab at -10, but exceptions can be made.</b></b></p>
<p><b>If interested</b>, please reply with your stats and EE merits so I can confirm the pay.</p>
