[b][size=24]Pay Scale[/size][/b]

[u]Note[/u]: If you were here before we reached 3 stars you are on a higher scale until the current scale offers more.

[b]Base pay is 15x your highest stat[/b]
[color=green]+$50,000 per EE merit[/color]
[color=green]+Rounded up to the next increment of $100,000[/color]
Capped at $5,000,000 per day

I update pay regularly, but feel free to message me if you get more EE merits so I can update it quicker.

[b][size=24]Trains[/size][/b]

Trains are on rotation and always will be to encourage long term employees alongside the linear pay scale.

[b][size=24]Addiction & Inactivity[/size][/b]

If you exceed -10 addiction or 1 day inactive I will remove you from the train rotation for that day.
If you exceed -20 addiction or 2 days inactive I will remove your pay and start looking for a replacement.

Exceptions can be made, please let me know in advance.

[b][size=24]Goals[/size] [/b](created 11/13/2023)

Ten stars was the goal before I even created the company. I intend to get us there as quickly as possible.
Each star has a hidden lifetime income requirement and takes [u]roughly[/u] 1.5x as long as the previous star.
This means we will not star up every week, so I will outline below [u]my best guess[/u] for each star.

One star: [color=green]Achieved November 19th, 2023[/color]
Two stars: [color=green]Achieved November 26th, 2023[/color]
Three stars: [color=green]Achieved December 3rd, 2023[/color]
Four stars: [color=green]Achieved December 17th, 2023[/color]
Five stars: [color=green]Achieved December 24th, 2023[/color]
Six stars: [color=green]Achieved January 7th, 2024[/color]
Seven stars: ~February 4th
Eight stars:  ~March 3rd
Nine stars: ~April 14th
Ten stars: ~June 23rd
